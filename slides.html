      # Mapping the Internet
      
      ???
      Hey everyone. I'm super excited to talk to you about this today.
      
      Internet access is something that is very close to my heart. I know how fleeting it can be and how difficult everyday activities are when you don't have it. It goes beyond being the only person in the office not to have seen Stranger Things, or not having Facebook on your phone. A lack of internet access can become a real issue in someone's life, and I've been interested in how to fix this issue for a long time.

      Don't forget to breathe.
      Take it slow.
      You'll do great.

      Can you raise your hand if you were online today? It's kind of unfair since I'm talking to a room full of tech people, but it holds true for basically every industry today. And perhaps even more so outside of work.
      
      Could you raise your hand if you *didn't* go online at all last weekend?

      # Internet Access By The Numbers
      
      * 64% of Americans have smartphones
      
      ???
      Smartphones, much like the web itself, are ubiquitious in the United States. It seems like nearly everyone has one, but for many it is their only access to the internet.

      # Internet Access By The Numbers
      
      * 64% have smartphones 
        - 1 in 5 adults lack consistent internet beyond their phone
      
      ???
      
      64% of Americans have cell phones, but of those 19% don't have consistent internet access beyond their phone -- this number comes out to between 35 and 40 million Americans.
      
      Inconsistent access might mean that they don't have internet in their home, or that they don't have access to public places like libraries or panera where internet is available.

      # Internet Access By The Numbers
      
      * 15%: owned a smartphone 
        - limited options for internet beyond phones
      
      ???
      To go further, 15% indicated that they have limited options for accessing the internet outside of their cellphone. 
      
      This can mean being limited to the public library, or public spaces like Starbucks or other businesses offering internet. It could also mean that they aren't close enough to any businesses to be able to take advantage of this, or there just aren't any public spaces with internet.

      * Income: Incomes under $30k

      ???
      The greatest predictor of having internet in your home is income.
