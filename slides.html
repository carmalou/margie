      ???
      Hey everyone. I'm super excited to talk to you about this today.
      
      Internet access is something that is very close to my heart. I know how fleeting it can be and how difficult everyday activities are when you don't have it. It goes beyond being the only person in the office not to have seen Stranger Things, or not having Facebook on your phone. A lack of internet access can become a real issue in someone's life, and I've been interested in how to fix this issue for a long time.

      Can you raise your hand if you were online today? It's kind of unfair since I'm talking to a room full of tech people, but it holds true for basically every industry today. And perhaps even more so outside of work.
      
      Could you raise your hand if you *didn't* go online at all last weekend?

      # A few handy Turf functions

      ```JavaScript
      var features = turf.featureCollection([
        turf.point([-75.343, 39.984], {"name": "Location A"}),
        turf.point([-75.833, 39.284], {"name": "Location B"}),
        turf.point([-75.534, 39.123], {"name": "Location C"})
      ]);

      var enveloped = turf.envelope(features);
      ```
      <sub>Source: [http://turfjs.org/docs/#envelope](http://turfjs.org/docs/#envelope)</sub>

      ???
      This function will return a polygon -- specifically a rectangle -- which contains the designated points.

      # A few handy Turf functions

      ```JavaScript
      var polygon = turf.polygon([ / ... / ]);

      ```
      <sub>Source: [http://turfjs.org/docs/#centerOfMass](http://turfjs.org/docs/#centerOfMass)</sub>

      ???
      This function accepts a polygon and will return a single point -- the center of the polygon.

      # A few handy Turf functions

      ```JavaScript
      var from = turf.point([-75.343, 39.984]);
      var to = turf.point([-75.534, 39.123]);
      var options = {units: 'miles'};

      var distance = turf.distance(from, to, options);
      ```
      <sub>Source: [http://turfjs.org/docs/#distance](http://turfjs.org/docs/#distance)</sub>

      ???
      This function accepts two points and will return the distance between the two points
      ---
      class: left, middle, inverse, inverse

      # A few handy Turf functions

      ```JavaScript
      var points = turf.points([ / ... / ]);

      var searchWithin = turf.polygon([ / ... / ]);

      var ptsWithin = turf.pointsWithinPolygon(points, searchWithin);
      ```
      <sub>Source: [http://turfjs.org/docs/#pointsWithinPolygon](http://turfjs.org/docs/#pointsWithinPolygon)</sub>

      ???
      This function takes in a single point or a list of points, and a second parameter -- a polygon. It checks to see if each point exists within the specified polygon. It returns a list of points that _do_ exist within the polygon.

      This is the function I used most to determine which libraries exist within certain polygons -- most notably counties.

      This isn't to say that there aren't some counties with high incomes and less libraries -- or some counties with lower incomes and more libraries. But when I looked at high/low counties for income, I've consistently seen lower-income counties having less access to libraries.

      The gap becomes even more apparent when we look at only counties below the poverty line -- those counties all have less than 5 libraries.
